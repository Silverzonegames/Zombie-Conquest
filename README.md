# Zombie-Conquest
In Zombie Conquest, the world has fallen victim to a zombie outbreak and humanity is on the brink of extinction because of YOU. In this "tower offense" game, you take the role of the zombies and attack humanity and take down its turrets. Collect brains and summon different types of zombies to find the best way to take down outposts!

How to play:

Your objective is to take down the outpost of each level. For this, you can use different types of zombies that are at your disposal, each with their unique traits. To summon zombies, you must collect brains. Brains can be collected by doing damage to turrets and destroying them. Be careful not to run out, otherwise you lose! There are 5 lanes in total that you can attack on, each with defenses in your way. And no spamming on one lane! Every lane can only have a certain amount of zombies on it. Find the best strategy to win each level and destroy the outposts!

Good luck!
